- Click-outside-to-close functionality

#### Rich Content Areas
- **Green Energy**: Renewable energy mix charts, production trends, real-time metrics
- **Maintenance**: System health indicators, maintenance status, activity logs
- **Carbon Emissions**: Emissions by sector, net zero progress, reduction metrics

### 3. Animation System

#### Performance Optimized
- CSS-based animations for smooth performance
- GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Automatic animation pause/resume controls

#### Visual Feedback
- Hover effects on all interactive elements
- Status indicator pulsing animations
- Data flow visualizations
- Loading states with shimmer effects

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Import the Enhanced Component

Replace the existing AdvancedAnalytics import in your main application:

```typescript
// Replace this:
import { AdvancedAnalytics } from './components/AdvancedAnalytics';

// With this:
import { EnhancedAdvancedAnalytics } from './components/EnhancedAdvancedAnalytics';
```

### Step 2: Add Enhanced Styling

Import the enhanced CSS in your main CSS file or component:

```css
@import './styles/enhanced-analytics.css';
```

### Step 3: Update Component Usage

Replace the component usage:

```tsx
// Replace this:
<AdvancedAnalytics className="your-classes" />

// With this:
<EnhancedAdvancedAnalytics className="your-classes" />
```

### Step 4: Verify Dependencies

Ensure all required dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install jointjs framer-motion recharts
```

## Configuration Options

### Animation Controls
- Toggle animations on/off with the "Pause/Resume Animations" button
- Automatic performance scaling based on device capabilities
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

### Theming
- TruContext brand colors integrated throughout
- Consistent color coding for different system types
- Dark theme optimized for operations center environments

### Data Integration
- Real-time data binding through existing store system
- Automatic visual updates when data changes
- Performance-optimized update batching

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Node Types

1. Create a new node type in the SmartCityNode class:

```typescript
const newNode = new SmartCityNode();
newNode.set({
  nodeType: 'security',
  position: { x: 200, y: 400 }
});
newNode.attr({
  icon: { text: '🛡️' },
  label: { text: 'Security' },
  body: { stroke: '#8b5cf6' },
  statusIndicator: { fill: '#8b5cf6' }
});
```

2. Add corresponding content component:

```typescript
const SecurityContent = () => {
  // Your security dashboard content
  return <div>Security monitoring content</div>;
};
```

3. Update the modal handler to include the new type.

### Modifying Animations

Animations can be customized in the CSS file:

```css
/* Adjust pulse timing */
@keyframes pulse-animation {
  0% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 0.8; }
  100% { transform: scale(2); opacity: 0; }
}

/* Change flow speed */
.energy-flow-line {
  animation: flow-dash 1s linear infinite; /* Faster flow */
}
```

### Color Scheme Customization

Update the TruContext brand colors:

```css
.trucontext-primary { color: #your-primary-color; }
.trucontext-secondary { color: #your-secondary-color; }
.trucontext-accent { color: #your-accent-color; }
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Automatic animation complexity reduction on low-performance devices
- Memory management for long-running animations
- Efficient data update batching
- GPU-accelerated animations where possible

### Monitoring
- Built-in performance monitoring
- Automatic quality scaling
- Memory leak prevention
- Responsive design adaptation

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
